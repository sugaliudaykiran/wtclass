			Fräulein Rottenmeier, views the household disruptions as wanton misbehaviour, and places Heidi under more and more restraint. 
			Soon, Heidi becomes terribly homesick and grows alarmingly pale and thin. Her one diversion is learning to read and write, 
			motivated by Clara's grandmother, who shows her trust and affection, and encourages her to believe in God and to pray. 
			Heidi's intractable homesickness leads to an episode of sleepwalking, and the family doctor recommends she be sent home as a 
			matter of urgency before she becomes seriously ill.
